					"React": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "I've been working in react for a few years now and have to say I love the library. Something about being able to freely structure my application in a very modular and compartmentalized way is just satisfying. I've written several enterprise level applications in with React.",
						"experience": "2+ years"
					},
					"Javascript": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "Javascript is the language of the web. Every website worth looking at has at least some Javascript and nowadays a lot of websites run solely on Javascript. I have a personal affection for the language because it allows me to give applications some flare.",
						experience: "5+ years"
					},
					"Python": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "Just the origins of this language's name screams fun. I absolutely adore writing Python whether as a full blown application or just a quick script. It's just a plus that it is one of the premier languages for both automation software and data aggregation.",
						experience: "2+ years"},
					"Django": {
						rating: 2, 
						description: "Every language has a niche in the beginning but sometimes expands to much more. Django helps Python go from a brilliant scripting language to a super powered back-end web language. I personally like Django for its templating system as it allows for rapid application development.",
						experience: "1.5 years"
					},
					"Bootstrap": {
						rating: 2, 
						description: "When I first started web development, I was told not to use Bootstrap because it was a crutch. As I came into my own, I realized it's not a crutch but a tool like any other, and a beautiful one at that. Nothing beats custom CSS for aesthetics with infinite time, but if you have a deadline then Bootstrap is often your best bet.",
						experience: "1.5 years"
					},
					"HTML5": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "HTML is the skeleton of the internet. Every single page of every single website has HTML. It's not overly complex and is quite ugly if alone but is one of the most important things to learn for any sort of web development work.",
						experience: "5+ years" 
					},
					"CSS3": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "CSS3 is what makes everything pretty. Without CSS, I probably would've never gotten into development. Being able to transform a few simple blocks of text into some magnificent work of art is something that never gets old. It also helps fill that artistic hole in my life since I draw worse than my 1 year old son.",
						experience: "5+ years" 
					},
					"jQuery": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "JavaScript is a very verbose and powerful language; jQuery has all the power with none of the verbosity (well, at least trims down on the alot of it). jQuery makes manipulating the DOM fast and easy while abstracting away some of the complexity. However, I've found myself drifting away from it because of the extra bloat it can bring to applications.",
						experience: "5+ years" 
					},
					"Angular": {
						rating: 2, 
						description: "Angular was the first front-end framework I ever worked with and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The two-way data binding was revolutionary to me and the MVC concept I was familiar with made transitioning into a front-end framework easy. I transitioned to React for career reasons but have kept up with the latest trends.",
						experience: "1 year" 
					},
					"PHP": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "PHP was the first language I really got into when I started back-end web development. I cut my teeth in the jungle of PHP5 and learned my first MVC framework in PHP. That said, I have started using Python and have no reason to use PHP at the moment. I keep up with the trends just in case, and have found PHP7 to be quite the exciting experience.",
						experience: "5+ years" 
					},
					"Laravel": {
						rating: 2, 
						description: "Laravel, to me, makes PHP fun again. It takes a language that has a lot of unelegant parts that just aren't fun and makes them eloquent (see what I did there?). The Eloquent ORM and the blade templating system combine to make developing PHP applications fast and easy.",
						experience: "1 year" 
					},
					"SQL": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "All web applications have one thing in common: data. Some people keep their data in files but for apps it's better to keep them organized in databases. When you use a database, going with the SQL variant allows you to keep everything relational and separate.",
						experience: "5+ years" 
					},
					"Docker": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "Docker is above and beyond my favorite technology in development today. Being able to containerize everything and spin it up on an infinite amount of machines is fascinating. You can have your application run once on six machines or six times on one machine; best of all, it allows for very rapid applciation development and deployment.",
						experience: "2+ years" 
					},
					"Jenkins": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "Knowing how to go through the deployment process is invaluable. Knowing how to automate that process is whatever is better than invaluable. Jenkins has been my clingy sidekick in deploying any kind of software. He spits out nice metrics, always reminds you of your failures, and notifies you of every little thing he accomplishes (or fails to). He is the Alfred to a developer's Batman.",
						experience: "2+ years" 
					},
					"Windows": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "To say Microsoft has the largest market share of consumer operating systems is an understatement. I always used Windows for everything when I was growing up and first starting out in development. I quickly outgrew the OS once I started getting into development as Unix is invaluable, but you can't game as well on any other OS.",
						experience: "5+ years" 
					},
					"MacOS": {
						rating: 3, 
						description: "Not going to lie, MacOS is my favorite of all operating systems for both development and casual use. I love the gesture controls and the terminal while still being extremely user friendly like Windows. It's not just the software but also how flawlessly it integrates with the hardware that Macs so popularly come with nowadays.",
						experience: "3+ years" 
					},
					"Linux": {
						rating: 2, 
						description: "MacOS may be my favorite OS, but there is no arguing that Linux performs the best. Before people get mad at me, I know \"Linux\" has a lot of different flavors like Ubuntu, Debian, and Alpine. Each of those have their own quirks and a lot of people look at Linux distributions as a bunch of different operating systems. However, I didn't want to make a list of all of the different distributions. Feel free to ask my opinion on any one in particular!",
